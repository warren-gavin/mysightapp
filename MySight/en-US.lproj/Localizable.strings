You will be shown a series of colors like the one below.";

Any color is a mix of three primary colors; blue, red and green. Colorblindness, or Color Vision Deficiency (CVD), is the inability to correctly interpret one of those three colors.";

If a person with CVD has a problem seeing **red**, they are a **Protan**.

If a person with CVD has a problem seeing **green**, they are a **Deutan**.

If you want to be more precise you factor in if they have anomalous trichromacy or dichromacy.

A Tritan with anomalous trichromacy has **Tritanomaly**, and a Tritan with dichromacy has **Tritanopia**.

A Protan with anomalous trichromacy has **Protanomaly**, and a Protan with dichromacy has **Protanopia**.

A Deutan with anomalous trichromacy has **Deuteranomaly**, and a Deutan with dichromacy has **Deuteranopia**.
